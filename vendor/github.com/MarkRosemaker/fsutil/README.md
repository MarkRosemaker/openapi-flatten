  Take a filesystem, not a path.
</h3>

`fsutil` provides file operations written against
[`afero.Fs`](https://github.com/spf13/afero) rather than against the real
filesystem, so the code that calls them can be tested without touching a disk.

> **Status: early.** Only copying is here so far. The rest arrives as each
> operation earns its place.

## Introduction

A function that calls `os.Create` has decided, permanently, that it writes to the
real filesystem. Testing it means a temporary directory, cleanup, and the quiet
possibility of one test seeing another's leftovers. A function that takes an
`afero.Fs` has decided nothing: production passes `afero.NewOsFs()`, a test passes
`afero.NewMemMapFs()`, and the same code runs against both.

That is the convention this module exists to make cheap. `afero` supplies the
filesystem abstraction and the operations the standard library has; `fsutil` adds
the ones it does not, in the same shape — filesystem first, paths after.

```go
// Reaches for the disk, whatever the caller wanted.
func writeReport(path string) error

// Writes wherever it is told to.
func writeReport(fs afero.Fs, path string) error
```

## Usage

```bash
go get github.com/MarkRosemaker/fsutil
```

```go
import (
    "github.com/MarkRosemaker/fsutil"
    "github.com/spf13/afero"
)

// Copies within one filesystem, creating the destination directory as needed.
if err := fsutil.Copy(afero.NewOsFs(), "api/openapi.json", "build/openapi.json"); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The copy creates any missing parent directories, preserves the source file's
permissions on a best-effort basis, and syncs before returning.

In a test, the same call runs entirely in memory:

```go
fs := afero.NewMemMapFs()
afero.WriteFile(fs, "src.txt", []byte("hello"), 0o644)

if err := fsutil.Copy(fs, "src.txt", "nested/dst.txt"); err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
}
```

### When the filesystem is not in question

Command-line tools and code generators operate on the real filesystem by
definition, and threading `afero.NewOsFs()` through them buys nothing. The
`osutil` subpackage is the same operations with that argument already applied:

```go
import "github.com/MarkRosemaker/fsutil/osutil"

if err := osutil.Copy("api/openapi.json", "build/openapi.json"); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

| Package | Signature | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `fsutil` | `Copy(fs afero.Fs, src, dst string) error` | The caller should be able to choose the filesystem — which is most of the time |
| `fsutil/osutil` | `Copy(src, dst string) error` | The real filesystem is the whole point, as in a CLI or a generator |

## Used by

The [openapi](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi) family reaches for
`osutil` in the generators that build their test fixtures:
[openapi-flatten](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-flatten),
[openapi-compress](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-compress) and
[openapi-codegen](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/openapi-codegen).
